# My journey to Data Science

Hey, there 🙃
I'm Nathan and I've been working with software development for the past 9 years. Most of this time I spent on the frontend side of things. The past 4 years my focus has been Javascript/Typescript and React, but also doing some backend stuff here and there because I'm curious.

One of my hobbies is writing. I always liked to translate my thoughts and feelings into text and it is always a surprise when this output makes sense to other people, but at the same time there was always this huge gap between coding and writing, even though I think that coding is also communicating, it is an intent express in code.

Data Science always looked interesting to me, but I have to confess that everytime I tried to catch up with it or to learn something I felt lost and intimidated. There are a bunch of resources out there. Some start with Python or R and give you all the functions ready, but I felt that knowing how the libraries work still wouldn't take me far if I really want to bridge this gap inside of me and tell stories while coding. I became clear to me that this is a huge area. Just to mention Some of the skills needed: Python or R, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and the most feared ones: some math and statistics.

I decided that I would start learning some statistics because I really want to understand how I'm telling these stories with data. Guess what? Got frustrated. A lot. I couldn't understand much. At least from the courses I took the content assumed that you already knew a lot of things that I didn't. I gave up at least 3 times. I was frustrated. I tried hard to apply what I learned in real world and I couldn't because it was a bunch of formulas or equations that I couldn't apply to real life only to the problesm proposed in very specific exercises. I didn't feel I had autonomy to analyse data on my own.

I tried again and this time it looks like I'm starting to understand how these things correlate to each other. It's being a journey, but I'm liking it a lot. I'll go through everything I can to have at least a good basis around Data science and I'll document my journey here. Maybe it will make sense to you. Keep in mind that I'm already an engineer for quite some time so I'll not document from scratch and explain what variables, functions, algorithms, etc. are.

I'm super excited to see the two things that I like most in life coming together. Feel free to interact here with me. I appreciate it.

Let's tell some stories.
